# 🏥 Healthcare Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes hospital patient data to identify patterns in length of stay, healthcare charges, discharge status, and gender-based outcomes. It simulates a real-world healthcare scenario by evaluating operational metrics across departments and conditions.

## 📂 Dataset

- Source: Mock Hospital Patient Dataset
- Format: CSV
- Fields: Patient ID, Department, Condition Type, Length of Stay, Age Group, Discharge Status, Gender, Charges

## 🧼 Data Cleaning Steps

- Converted all numeric fields to proper number format
- Removed missing/blank price or stay duration entries
- Standardized department and condition labels
- Reformatted Patient IDs to 8-digit numeric format

## 📊 Pivot Tables

1. **Average Length of Stay by Department**  
2. **Total Charges by Condition Type**  
3. **Average Length of Stay by Gender**

## 📈 Visualizations

- Pie chart: Length of stay by gender  
- Bar chart: Top 5 most expensive conditions  
- Column chart: Average stay by department

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel (data cleaning, analysis, and charts)
- GitHub (documentation and version control)

## ✅ Key Insights

- Cardiology and ICU departments had the highest average stay durations
- Viral and chronic conditions generated the highest charges
- Female patients had a slightly lower average stay than male patients
